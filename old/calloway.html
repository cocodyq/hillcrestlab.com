		<h1>Calloway Safari Extension</h1>
		<p>I made a safari extension that blocks one of my buddy's twitter icons. I'm not providing a link to his page because you'd click on it, and understand why I made this. I wouldn't want to do that to you. There's certain things you can't unsee, so just trust me: You do <strong>not</strong> want to see his icons.</p>

		<h2>Future</h2>
		<p>If you're interested in the code, I'll put in on github eventually. I might add other features. But for now, the most important thing was getting it out there.</p>
