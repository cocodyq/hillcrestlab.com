<h2>Location Based Reminders for iPhone</h2>
<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/regions/id392441093?mt=8">Regions</a> is a simple iPhone app that reminds you to do things based on where you are. How simple is it?</p>

<ol>
	<li>Create a new reminder</li>
	<li>Pick a location from the map</li>
	<li>That's it.</li>
</ol>

<p>The next time you are roughly near the purple region, you will receive a notification reminding you of whatever it is that you need to do. You have the ability to specify how close you should be before receiving the reminder. Regions doesn't use GPS in the background, which means that you shouldn't notice any significant reduction in battery life.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>

	<li>Location based reminders</li>
	<li>Minimalist User Interface</li>

	<li>Specify the distance from your point of interest</li>
</ul>
